    <h3 id="texto">Currently studying Computer Science for the third semester, I have practical experience in sales, both in person and online
        (including using WhatsApp) in a stationery store. During this journey, I have developed skills to understand customer needs, 
         negotiate and build customer loyalty, which has allowed me to apply customized solutions and optimize communication. <br>

        In addition to my commercial knowledge, I am delving deeper into web development, with experience in Python, HTML, CSS and 
        JavaScript, and knowledge of MySQL databases. I am currently expanding my knowledge of the Java language, aiming to 
        integrate programming techniques with customer service and sales management. <br>
        
        I have advanced English and am always looking for new challenges and professional development, combining technical and commercial 
        skills to generate results that drive growth and customer satisfaction. I am interested in working in environments that encourage 
        innovation and continuous learning, contributing to projects that add value to the company and the team. <br>
        
        I am confident that my practical experience, combined with my training and motivation, will allow me to contribute significantly 
        to the challenges proposed by the position.
